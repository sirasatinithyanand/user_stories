Using openAi to generate user_stories

Purpose: To speed up the generation of user stories in the SDLC

Project Description:
This project aims to speed up the process of generating user stories. A typical person would take 1 to 2 days to physically write user stories.
Using Generative AI this process can be cut down to an hour. We are talking about the 400 to 500 user stories being generated in just under an hour.
This project uses gpt-4 to generate the user stores.
